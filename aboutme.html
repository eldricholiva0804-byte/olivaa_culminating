        <p> I am Eldrich L. Oliva, 17 years old, and currently residing at Neo Vista Homes, Bagumbong, Caloocan City. I am a senior high school student at Escuela de Sophia of Caloocan Inc., <br>where I continue to pursue my passion for learning, creativity, and personal growth. As someone who enjoys expressing ideas through visuals, I specialize in photography, videography,<br> and digital editing. I'm also an active individual who engages in various sports like badminton, volleyball, and basketball, which help me develop discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
        <p> Throughout my experiences from grade 7 - 12, I have been a consistent honor student and recipient of multiple awards such as the Bronze Seal and Model Student recognitions. <br>I've also taken part in several seminars that have expanded my knowledge on topics like health, fitness, and career development. These experiences have shaped me <br>into a well-rounded and goal-oriented student who is passionate about both academics and creative work. As I prepare for college, I look forward to further developing <br>my skills, exploring new opportunities, and contributing meaningfully to the community I will be part of.</p>
